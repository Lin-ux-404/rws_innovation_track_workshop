      "However, with great power comes significant responsibility—enter the ethical considerations. The integration of AI in healthcare raises essential concerns about data privacy, algorithmic bias, and accountability. Can we trust machines with our most sensitive health information? Regulatory frameworks like HIPAA in the U.S. and GDPR in Europe aim to protect personal health data, but significant challenges remain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, the potential for bias in AI systems is particularly concerning. As these systems learn from historical data, they can inadvertently reflect existing disparities in healthcare, leading to unequal treatment outcomes for marginalized groups. Ongoing dialogue and research are critical to addressing these issues and ensuring fairness in AI applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, as AI continues to evolve, so must the role of healthcare professionals. Caregivers are increasingly becoming interpreters of AI insights, requiring a careful balance between human intuition and machine-driven analysis. It’s crucial that training programs equip practitioners with the knowledge needed to effectively utilize AI while maintaining a patient-centered approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "As we navigate this burgeoning intersection of AI and healthcare, fostering dialogue among technologists, ethicists, and healthcare providers is essential. Through responsible innovation and ethical oversight, we can unlock AI's potential to enhance health outcomes and ensure equitable access to care. The revolution in healthcare is underway; let us ensure it serves everyone fairly.\n",

    "\n",
    "The sequential selection we just used is one of several agent collaboration patterns. Here are some common patterns you might use:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sequential (Round-Robin)**: Agents take turns in a fixed order\n",
    "   - Pros: Simple, predictable, ensures each agent participates\n",
    "   - Cons: Not responsive to content; might include irrelevant contributions\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Fixed Workflow**: Agents follow a specific sequence designed for a task\n",
    "   - Pros: Mirrors real workflows (e.g., write → edit → approve)\n",
    "   - Cons: Less flexible for unexpected situations\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Dynamic Selection**: An LLM decides which agent should respond next\n",
    "   - Pros: More responsive to conversation needs; adaptable\n",
    "   - Cons: Less predictable; requires careful prompt engineering\n",
    "\n",
